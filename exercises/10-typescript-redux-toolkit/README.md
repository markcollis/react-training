## TypeScript and Redux Toolkit

Having switched to TS after Exercise 4, I have created a new exercise folder to build on rather than having to convert each of the existing exercises to TS. The starting point is with Exercise 5 (reselect) implemented and using @reduxjs/toolkit instead of reduxsauce. All dependencies are current versions as of 8/1/2020.
